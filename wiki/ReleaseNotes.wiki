===trunk - xxx===
*Changes impacting users:*
  * *IMPORTANT:* Moved and renamed servlet to com.purej.vminspect.http.servlet.VmInspectionServlet
  * New class VmInspectionServer for standalone usage without having to use a servlet-container
  * Users can add their own statistics by implementing the new ValueProvider interface and registering it at the StatisticsCollector
*Bug fixes and optimizations:*
  * Cookie values are encoded/decoded to support non-http conform characters in searches
  * StatisticsCollector ensures that there is only one instance running per VM/classloader (also if multiple servlet-instances are used)
  * Statistics ranges (UI choices) are preserved even if cookies are disabled
  * Showing the converted value in the status-message after setting an attribute instead of the original value
  * Clean separation between http-handling (package .http) and html-producing (package .html)
  * Lots more unit-test for higher coverage
  * Utility methods moved to util package to clean up package dependencies (no more cycles)

*0.6 - 29.12.2013*
